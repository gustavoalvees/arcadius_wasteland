    # Whenever an Enhanced Mob kills a parasite past Evolution Phase 3, their remains may be replaced with a Saltine.

    # Settings which affect Enhanced Mobs, stronger variants of mobs which spawn naturally at a chance, and target parasites on sight.
    # With Ante enabled, they will get stronger over time as well.
    # Enhanced Mobs have unique properties intended to combat parasites, or at least make the fight more difficult:
    # Effect Cap - Enhanced Mobs cannot receive negative potion effects with an amplifier greater than III.
    # Passive Speed - Enhanced Mobs will periodically give themselves the Speed effect.
    # Damage Cap - If damage exceeds a certain percentage of the mob's total health (including defense) it will be capped off. However, this will weaken each time.
    # Hyper Armor - If damage taken is below this value, it is healed instead. Minimum Damage below this value is also cut in half.
    # Defense - Similar to Absorption, usually applied as a multiple of base maximum health. Minimum Damage will target this first.
    # Bane - Extra damage dealt only to parasites.
    # Critical Hits - At a chance, Enhanced Mobs will deal a critical hit when attacking a mob, at range or with melee. This attack deals increased damage, ignites the target for several seconds, and harms targets around it.
    # Yielding on Hit - When attacking a mob, Enhanced Mobs will apply the Yielding potion effect (stacking if it is a Crit), which causes any attacks received to deal a percentage of the target's health as True Damage. It also reduces Immunity Frames.
    # Motes - Every so often in combat, Enhanced Mobs will spawn damaging Motes to chase down their targets. These can apply Gravity to pull targets down to earth or even teleport the Enhanced Mob to the target.
